1	1	"This is about electric cars that are super small, like nanometer level small"
2	2	"This is also about cars that are nanometer small, but this time we use monolayer self assembly"
3	3	"This is also about cars that are nanometer small, but this time we use copolymer directed assembly"
4	4	Can we talk a little bit about nano planktons. These are made of methanofullerene
5	5	Let's talk about self assembling computers that have nothing to do with small sizes
6	6	Glass tumblers made by tunnel microscopy tend to break earlier
7	7	It's simple. It's nano quantum wiring
8	8	Fill the bucket with ferrofluid
9	9	Steel tumblers made by magnetic force microscopy and enforced with quantum superfluid are stronger than glasses made in #6
10	10	Build ip phones using array based porous silicon for attaining salvation
11	11	The bag is made of multilayer molecular sieve
12	12	"Do not touch a baby bats, it will cause molecular imprinting"
13	13	quasi-crystals are bad ornaments
14	14	Quantum doting is popular way for new moms to express their love to newborns
15	15	Human body does not carry Nanogomphodon. Neither does a buckyball
16	16	"Nanophydinae are cool, literally"
