"Rivercity Hydraulics","122 Magnet Dr","Sherwood","AR","72120","Rivercityhyd.Com","River City Hydraulics, Inc was founded in 1982 by Harry Long. Initially, the company's aim was to be a hydraulic repair shop, performing maintenance on hydraulic valves, cylinders, pumps and motors. In addition, we designed and manufactured hydraulic and pneumatic automated machines for specialized projects in the private sector. Although a large percentage of our business originated in the mobile hydraulic repair sector, we also sought out industrial accounts, performing major repairs on injection molding machines, printing machines, bag machines, lumber mills, and various assembly plants. This varied market was a profitable endeavor as we were able to design/redesign machines as the need arose. As time passed, we found the mobile industry to be a more lucrative market as it was less controlled by the economy, especially true in the refuse industry. Though not a major component of our business at first, we gained experience repairing refuse trucks and compactors. Our customers approached us with the possibility of retailing new models instead of only repairing existing trucks. At that time in Arkansas, Pac-mor was the most widely known and utilized in the area, so we naturally became dealers for this and other entities like Leach. After a period of negations with representatives from the Heil corporation, we also decided to represent their prestigious line. Heil proved to be an especially good fit for our growing company as we were already dealers for smaller lines like Tymso Air Sweepers, Galbreath Hoist, Peterson Loaders, and Stellar Hook Lifts. The company continued to grow as our reputation in the expanding field of hydraulics became cemented by dozens of satisfied customers. We began in 1982 with a one-bay shop and a small three-office rental building. In the early 1990's, we bought a half-acre plot on which our new 6000 square foot shop was to be located. Just in the previous year, we have purchased an additional acre in our hometown hometown Sherwood AR, which will become home to a new 6000 sq. ft building holding four supplemental working bays. We also maintain a facility in West Memphis, AR which manages sales and contratcts for Tennessee, Missouri, and part of Arkansas. River City Hydraulics has been serving Arkansas and the surrounding areas for 25 years. As a whole, we believe we represent the top manufacturing companies in the refuse industry. Our primary line is Heil, a product that was virtually non-existent in our territory prior to our becoming dealers for this quality company. Per Heil corporate report, 86% of the packer bodies in use in our region were produced by their company, demonstrating the aggressiveness and productivity of our committed sales team. We carry a profuse inventory of replacement parts and a qualified parts/installation team with over 50 years combined experience in the refuse industry. Each member is factory trained to aid customers in diagnosing which part is needed and how that particular part contributes to the overall functioning of the product. Our service personnel possess over 100 years combined experience and are qualified to repair equipment in each line that we handle, particularly excelling in automated packer bodies. They have an integral relationship with the Parts department to consistently upgrade our inventory to ensure a rapid repair turnaround. The salespeople at River City Hydraulics, Inc, both internal and external, are proactive and first-rate marketers. Through their extensive knowledge of all our equipment, they are able to assess potential customers' needs and provide them with the most appropriate product to suite their individual requirements. Our company motto is 'Service After The Sale' and this is evident in every aspect of our business. Throughout the industry, we have a reputation for honesty and sincerity from the top down. Our customers recognize that we will tackle any dilemma that arises and work with them to solve this quandary, even if it","811310","333914","333996","811310","999990","00014","$1,484,000","Private"
